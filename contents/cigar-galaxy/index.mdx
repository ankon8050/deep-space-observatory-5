<Highlight title="The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)" subtitle="A Starburst Galaxy in Ursa Major" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Type**: Starburst galaxy (Irr2, irregular galaxy)
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **12 million light-years**.
- **Location**: Found in the constellation **Ursa Major**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: ~**8.4** (bright enough to observe with small telescopes).
- **Dimensions**: Roughly **37,000 light-years in diameter** (much smaller than the Milky Way).

### **Why is it called the Cigar Galaxy?**
The galaxy earned its nickname due to its **elongated, cigar-like shape** when viewed from Earth. It appears edge-on, giving it a stretched appearance.

---

### **Starburst Activity**
- M82 is classified as a **starburst galaxy**, meaning it is undergoing an intense period of **star formation**, producing stars at a rate 10 times faster than that of the Milky Way.
- This starburst activity is triggered by gravitational interactions with its neighboring galaxy, **Messier 81 (M81)**.
- The tidal forces from this interaction have disrupted M82's structure, compressing gas and dust to fuel the birth of new stars.

### **Superwind Phenomenon**
One of the most striking features of the Cigar Galaxy is its **superwind**:
- Powerful winds, driven by supernova explosions and stellar winds from massive stars, are pushing gas and dust out of the galaxy.
- These superwinds form **red filamentary structures** of hydrogen gas that extend thousands of light-years from the galaxy's core. This phenomenon is visible in infrared and X-ray wavelengths.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Infrared Brightness**: M82 is the brightest galaxy in the sky in the **infrared spectrum**, making it an interesting object for astronomers studying star formation.
- **X-ray Emissions**: The galaxy is a strong source of X-rays due to the high-energy events occurring in its core and superwind regions.
- **Companion Galaxy**: M82 is gravitationally bound to **Messier 81 (Bode's Galaxy)**, a nearby spiral galaxy. Together, they form a beautiful pair of galaxies often studied together.

### **How to Observe the Cigar Galaxy**
- **Best Time to View**: Visible from **late winter to early spring** in the Northern Hemisphere.
- **Telescope**: Small telescopes can reveal its cigar-like shape, while larger telescopes and long-exposure astrophotography can unveil details like its filamentary superwind structures.

### **Fun Fact**
The Cigar Galaxy was home to a **Type Ia supernova (SN 2014J)**, discovered in January 2014. This supernova became one of the closest and brightest supernovae observed in recent years, making M82 even more famous in the astronomical community.
