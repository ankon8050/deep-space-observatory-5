<Highlight title="Jupiter" subtitle="The Largest Planet in the Solar System" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Type**: Gas Giant
- **Position in the Solar System**: 5th planet from the Sun
- **Distance from the Sun**: Approximately **778 million kilometers (484 million miles)**.
- **Diameter**: **139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles)**, making it the largest planet in the Solar System.
- **Mass**: **318 times the mass of Earth**.
- **Day Length**: **9 hours and 56 minutes** (shortest day of all planets).
- **Year Length**: **11.86 Earth years**.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- **Atmosphere**: Jupiter's atmosphere is composed primarily of **hydrogen (90%)** and **helium (10%)**, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor.
- **Great Red Spot**: A massive, persistent storm larger than Earth that has been raging for at least 300 years.
- **Cloud Bands**: Jupiter's atmosphere is divided into **colorful bands** of clouds, caused by strong winds and differences in chemical composition.

### **Moons**
- Jupiter has **95 known moons** (as of 2023), with the four largest being the **Galilean moons**:
1. **Io**: The most volcanically active body in the Solar System.
2. **Europa**: An icy moon with a subsurface ocean, considered a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life.
3. **Ganymede**: The largest moon in the Solar System, even bigger than Mercury.
4. **Callisto**: A heavily cratered moon with a possible subsurface ocean.

### **Magnetosphere**
- Jupiter has the **strongest magnetic field** of any planet in the Solar System, extending millions of kilometers into space.
- Its magnetosphere traps charged particles, creating intense radiation belts.

### **Exploration**
- **Pioneer 10 and 11**: The first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter in the 1970s.
- **Voyager 1 and 2**: Provided detailed images of Jupiter and its moons.
- **Galileo Orbiter**: Studied Jupiter and its moons from 1995 to 2003.
- **Juno Mission**: Currently orbiting Jupiter (since 2016), studying its atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Fast Rotation**: Jupiter's rapid rotation causes it to bulge at the equator, making it an oblate spheroid.
2. **Ring System**: Jupiter has a faint ring system made of dust particles, discovered by the Voyager spacecraft.
3. **Auroras**: Jupiter has spectacular auroras at its poles, caused by interactions between its magnetic field and charged particles from the Sun.

### **How to Observe Jupiter**
- **Naked Eye**: Jupiter is one of the brightest objects in the night sky and can often be seen without a telescope.
- **Telescope**: A small telescope can reveal Jupiter's cloud bands and its four largest moons.
- **Best Time to View**: Jupiter is best observed during **opposition**, when it is closest to Earth and fully illuminated by the Sun.

### **Personal Note**
Smart telescopes like Vaonis Vespera II are more effective to fetch images of the slightly
dimmer objects in the night sky. Closer objects like the planets in the solar system are
usually captured a bit hazy. However, considering Jupiter's immense size, it is still visible
up to a good extent. The reddish bands on it are quite clear in the image.
