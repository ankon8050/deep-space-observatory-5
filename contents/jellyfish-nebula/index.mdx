<Highlight title="The Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443)" subtitle="A Supernova Remnant in Gemini" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443), also known as Sharpless 248 (Sh2-248).
- **Type**: Supernova Remnant (SNR)
- **Location**: Constellation **Gemini**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **5,000 light-years**.
- **Size**: Roughly **70 light-years** across.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- The Jellyfish Nebula is the remnant of a massive star that exploded as a **supernova** between **3,000 and 30,000 years ago**.
- It features intricate filaments of glowing gas and dust, shaped by the shockwaves from the supernova explosion.
- The nebula is composed of ionized hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen, which emit light in distinct wavelengths, creating its vibrant appearance.
- A **neutron star**, the collapsed core of the original star, is believed to be located near the southern edge of the nebula.

---

### **Discovery and History**
- The Jellyfish Nebula has been extensively studied due to its proximity and its role as a textbook example of a supernova remnant.
- It is located near the bright stars **Tejat** and **Propus** in Gemini, making it relatively easy to locate for astronomers.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Visibility**: The Jellyfish Nebula is best observed during the **winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere when Gemini is high in the sky.
- **Best Observing Tools**: A telescope with narrowband filters (such as H-alpha, OIII, and SII) is ideal for capturing the nebula's intricate details and colors.
- **Astrophotography**: The nebula is a popular target for astrophotographers due to its complex structure and vibrant emission lines.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Supernova Remnant**: The nebula is the result of a high-mass star's violent death, leaving behind a stunning and chaotic structure.
2. **Neutron Star**: A rapidly spinning neutron star, known as **CXOU J061705.3+222127**, is thought to be the remnant of the original star.
3. **Shape and Name**: The nebula's nickname, "Jellyfish," comes from its resemblance to the shape of a jellyfish, with filaments resembling tentacles.

### **How to Locate the Jellyfish Nebula**
1. **Find Gemini**: Locate the constellation Gemini in the night sky. The nebula is near the stars **Tejat** and **Propus**.
2. **Use a Star Map**: A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint its exact location.
3. **Enhance Visibility**: Observing from a dark-sky location and using narrowband filters will improve your chances of seeing the nebula.

### **Personal Note**
With an exposure of a remarkable 59 minutes, we still can barely see the gaseous nebula. The
greater significance of this capture is that, this nebula is the remnant of a supernova that
occurred at least 3,000 years ago. The continuous and uninterrupted cycle of life for the stars
viewed by this simple image. At some point when we are long gone, this gaseous cloud may condense
to form new stars, planets, moons and so on. Only time will remain as proof as it did thousands
of years ago.
