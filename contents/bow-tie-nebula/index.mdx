<Highlight title="The Bow-Tie Nebula (NGC 40)" subtitle="A Planetary Nebula in the Constellation Cepheus" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Bow-Tie Nebula (NGC 40), also known as Caldwell 2.
- **Type**: Planetary Nebula
- **Location**: Constellation **Cepheus**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **5,280 light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: **11.6**, making it visible with medium-sized telescopes.
- **Size**: About **36 arcseconds** in diameter.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- The Bow-Tie Nebula is a **planetary nebula**, formed when a dying star ejects its outer layers of gas into space.
- The central star is a **hot, dying star** transitioning into a white dwarf. Its intense radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, causing it to glow.
- The nebula has a distinctive **bow-tie shape**, with bright red and pink hues caused by ionized hydrogen and nitrogen gases.
- The central star has a surface temperature of approximately **50,000 Kelvin**, making it extremely hot and luminous.

### **Discovery and History**
- The Bow-Tie Nebula was discovered by **William Herschel** on **November 25, 1788**.
- It was cataloged as **IV.58** in Herschel's deep-sky catalog and later included in the Caldwell catalog as Caldwell 2.

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Visibility**: Best observed during the **autumn and winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere when Cepheus is high in the sky.
- **Best Observing Tools**: A medium to large telescope is recommended to resolve the nebula's structure and colors. Narrowband filters (such as H-alpha) can enhance its visibility.
- **Nearby Objects**: The Bow-Tie Nebula is located in a rich star field in Cepheus, making it a great target for deep-sky observers.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Compact Size**: The Bow-Tie Nebula is relatively small compared to other planetary nebulae, but its high surface brightness makes it stand out.
2. **Central Star**: The central star is in the final stages of its life and will eventually cool into a white dwarf.
3. **Shape and Name**: The nebula's bow-tie or hourglass shape is caused by the interaction of stellar winds with the ejected material, creating a bipolar structure.

### **How to Locate the Bow-Tie Nebula**
1. **Find Cepheus**: Locate the constellation Cepheus in the northern sky. It is near the constellations Cassiopeia and Draco.
2. **Use a Star Map**: A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint the nebula's exact location.
3. **Enhance Visibility**: Observing from a dark-sky location and using a telescope with a wide aperture will improve your chances of seeing the nebula.

### **Personal Note**
A simple 10 minutes exposure was able to capture the brightness of this particular nebula,
which is still being fuelled by its star of origin. This is the first capture of a planetary nebula,
enabling me to learn about their specific characteristics. The actual object had to be zoomed in
quite a lot, resulting in the surrounding stars to shine over bright in the image. At approximately
1 light year in width, the nebula is very small compared to the visible portion of the sky.
