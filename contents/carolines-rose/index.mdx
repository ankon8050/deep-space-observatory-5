<Highlight title="Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789)" subtitle="A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789)
- **Other Names**: The White Rose Cluster, Herschel's Spiral Cluster
- **Type**: Open Star Cluster
- **Location**: Constellation **Cassiopeia**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **7,622 light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: **6.7**, making it visible with binoculars and small telescopes.
- **Age**: Estimated to be around **1.6 billion years old**.

---

### **Discovery**
- Caroline's Rose Cluster was discovered in **1783** by **Caroline Herschel**, a pioneering astronomer and comet-hunter.
- Her brother, **William Herschel**, later included it in his catalog as **H VI.30**.
- The cluster earned its nickname "Caroline's Rose" because its loops of stars and dark lanes resemble the petals of a rose when viewed visually.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- **Structure**: The cluster is unusually rich and densely packed with stars, creating a striking visual pattern of loops and dark voids that resemble a rose.
- **Star Composition**: The cluster contains a mix of white and yellow stars, which form intricate patterns resembling the borders of rose petals.
- **Size**: The cluster spans about **50 light-years** across.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Best Time to View**: Caroline's Rose Cluster is best observed during **autumn and winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Cassiopeia is high in the sky.
- **Visibility**: It is visible with **binoculars** or a **small telescope** under dark skies. Larger telescopes can reveal its intricate structure and individual stars.
- **Nearby Objects**: Located in the rich star fields of Cassiopeia, it is surrounded by other notable deep-sky objects, making it a great target for stargazing.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Cultural Significance**: The cluster is named after Caroline Herschel, one of the first women to make significant contributions to astronomy.
2. **Appearance**: The dark lanes and loops of stars give the impression of a rose, making it one of the most visually striking open clusters.
3. **Age and Evolution**: At 1.6 billion years old, the cluster is relatively old for an open cluster, and many of its original stars have already evolved into red giants.

### **How to Locate Caroline's Rose Cluster**
1. **Find Cassiopeia**: Locate the "W"-shaped constellation Cassiopeia in the northern sky.
2. **Look Between Stars**: The cluster is situated between the stars **Ruchbah (Delta Cassiopeiae)** and **Beta Cassiopeiae**.
3. **Use Binoculars or a Telescope**: Even binoculars can reveal the cluster's faint glow, while a telescope will show its intricate rose-like structure.

### **Personal Note**
The 17 minutes 30 seconds exposure managed to bring some fainter stars in the cluster, but
a few of the brighter ones became a bit too glazed. It was a bit challenging to capture the image
since confirmed count is about 2,799 stars in a span of 50 light years that is visible in the cluster
from earth. Using a glare reducing filter may have produced a better result here. The geometric
pattern at the centre of the image roughly forms that of a rose, resulting to the cluster
getting its name as such.
