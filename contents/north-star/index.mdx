<Highlight title="Polaris (The North Star)" subtitle="A Guiding Light in the Night Sky" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Polaris (also known as the North Star or Pole Star)
- **Designation**: Î± Ursae Minoris (Alpha Ursae Minoris)
- **Constellation**: Ursa Minor
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **323 light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: Fluctuates around **1.98**, making it the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor.

### **Why is Polaris Important?**
- Polaris is located **almost directly above Earth's north celestial pole**, making it a critical reference point for navigation.
- Unlike other stars, Polaris appears **fixed in the night sky**, as it aligns closely with Earth's rotational axis. This makes it a reliable marker for finding true north.
- Historically, Polaris has been used by travelers and sailors for centuries to navigate their way across land and sea.

---

### **Physical Characteristics**
- Polaris is a **pulsating Cepheid variable star**, meaning its brightness changes in a predictable cycle of about four days.
- It is part of a **multiple star system**, with two smaller companion stars orbiting it.
- The star's surface is dynamic, with new research revealing that it is not static but has a pulsating and evolving surface.

### **How to Find Polaris**
1. **Locate the Big Dipper**: Find the Big Dipper asterism in the northern sky.
2. **Use the Pointer Stars**: The two stars at the end of the Big Dipper's "bowl" (Dubhe and Merak) point directly to Polaris.
3. **Look for Ursa Minor**: Polaris is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, marking the end of the Little Dipper's handle.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Not Exactly at the Pole**: Polaris does not sit precisely at the north celestial pole but is very close, within about **0.7 degrees**.
2. **Future Changes**: Due to Earth's axial precession, Polaris will not always be the North Star. In about 13,000 years, the star Vega in the constellation Lyra will take its place.
3. **Standard Candle**: Polaris's predictable brightness variations make it a "standard candle" for astronomers to measure distances in space.

### **Cultural Significance**
- Polaris has been a symbol of **guidance and constancy** in many cultures.
- It is often associated with navigation, hope, and direction, appearing in literature, folklore, and art.

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Best Time to View**: Polaris is visible year-round in the Northern Hemisphere.
- **Location**: It is always found in the northern sky, making it a permanent fixture for stargazers.
- **Telescope View**: Through a telescope, you can observe Polaris's companion stars, which are part of its multiple star system.
