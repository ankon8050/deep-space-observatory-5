<Highlight title="Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)" subtitle="A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy in Ursa Major" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Type**: Grand Design Spiral Galaxy
- **Location**: Constellation **Ursa Major**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **12 million light-years**.
- **Size**: The galaxy has a diameter of about **96,000 light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: ~**6.9**, making it visible with small telescopes or binoculars.

---

### **Physical Characteristics**
- Bode's Galaxy is a **grand design spiral galaxy**, meaning it has well-defined and prominent spiral arms.
- It is one of the brightest galaxies in the **Messier Catalogue** and is often studied for its structure and star formation regions.
- The galaxy's spiral arms are rich in **young, hot stars** and regions of active star formation.

### **Interaction with the Cigar Galaxy (M82)**
- Bode's Galaxy is gravitationally interacting with its nearby companion, the **Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82)**.
- These interactions have influenced the structure and star formation activity in both galaxies, making them a fascinating pair for study.
- Together, M81 and M82 are often referred to as a **springtime galactic duo** and are popular targets for astrophotography.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Best Time to View**: Bode's Galaxy is best observed during **spring months** in the Northern Hemisphere.
- **Telescope Requirements**: It can be seen with **modest backyard telescopes** or even binoculars under dark skies.
- **Nearby Objects**: M81 is often observed alongside M82, as they are located close to each other in the sky.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Discovery**: Bode's Galaxy was discovered by **Johann Elert Bode** in 1774, after whom it is named.
2. **Structure**: Its well-defined spiral structure makes it a textbook example of a grand design spiral galaxy.
3. **Star Formation**: The galaxy contains regions of active star formation, particularly in its spiral arms.

### **How to Locate Bode's Galaxy**
- **Find Ursa Major**: Locate the constellation Ursa Major in the night sky.
- **Look Near the Big Dipper**: M81 is located near the "bowl" of the Big Dipper asterism.
- **Use a Telescope**: A small telescope or binoculars will reveal M81 as a faint, fuzzy patch of light. Larger telescopes can reveal its spiral structure.

### **Personal Note**
The Bode's Galaxy is visible in the bottom right corner, the brightest bit to be
more specific. It has been captured with its companion, the Cigar Galaxy in the
same frame.
