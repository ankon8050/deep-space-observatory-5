<Highlight title="The Orion Nebula (Messier 42)" subtitle="A Stellar Nursery in the Constellation Orion" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Orion Nebula (Messier 42, M42)
- **Type**: Diffuse Nebula
- **Location**: Constellation **Orion**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **1,344 light-years**.
- **Size**: The nebula spans about **24 light-years** across, with an apparent size of approximately **1 degree** in the night sky.
- **Mass**: Estimated to be about **2,000 times the mass of the Sun**.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- The Orion Nebula is a **star-forming region**, often referred to as a **stellar nursery**, where new stars are born from collapsing clouds of gas and dust.
- It contains over **3,000 stars** of varying sizes, nestled within a vast cavern of rolling dust and gas.
- The nebula is illuminated by a group of young, massive stars known as the **Trapezium Cluster**, which emits intense ultraviolet radiation that ionizes the surrounding gas, causing it to glow.

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Visibility**: The Orion Nebula is visible to the **naked eye** from dark sky locations and appears as a faint, fuzzy patch in the "Sword of Orion," located below Orion's Belt.
- **Best Time to View**: The nebula is best observed during **winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Orion is prominent in the night sky.
- **Telescope View**: Through a telescope, the nebula reveals intricate details, including its glowing gas clouds and the Trapezium Cluster at its core.
