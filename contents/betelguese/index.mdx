<Highlight title="Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis)" subtitle="A Red Supergiant in Orion" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Type**: Red Supergiant (Spectral Type M1-2 Ia-ab)
- **Constellation**: Orion
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **642 light-years** (recent Gaia measurements estimate between **500–700 light-years**).
- **Mass**: Estimated to be **10–20 times the mass of the Sun**.
- **Diameter**: Betelgeuse is **around 1,000 times the Sun's diameter** (if placed in the center of our Solar System, it would engulf the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and possibly Mars).
- **Luminosity**: Betelgeuse is **about 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun** in visible light.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: Ranges between **+0.0 and +1.6** due to its semi-regular variability.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- **Color**: Betelgeuse appears as a distinct **reddish star** in the night sky, a hallmark of its cooler surface temperature (~3,500 K).
- **Stage of Life**: Betelgeuse is in the **final stages of its life** as a massive star. It will eventually end its life in a **supernova explosion**, possibly within the next 100,000 years.
- **Variability**: Classified as a **semi-regular variable star**, Betelgeuse's brightness fluctuates due to complex pulsations in its outer layers.

### **Famous Dimming Event (2019–2020)**
- In late 2019 and early 2020, Betelgeuse experienced an **unprecedented dimming**, dropping to about **40% of its usual brightness**.
- This sparked speculation that Betelgeuse was on the verge of going supernova. However, astronomers determined that the dimming was caused by a **combination of surface cooling and ejected material forming a dust cloud**.
- The event highlighted the dynamic and unpredictable behavior of red supergiants.

### **Cultural and Astronomical Significance**
- **Mythology**: As part of the constellation Orion, Betelgeuse has been significant in many cultures and myths as one of the "shoulders" of the hunter.
- **Navigation**: Betelgeuse is one of the **brightest stars in the night sky**, making it an important navigational reference for stargazers and astronomers.
- **Astronomical Studies**: Betelgeuse has been the subject of extensive research, including **direct imaging of its surface**, which revealed its uneven brightness and massive convective cells.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Supernova Potential**: When Betelgeuse explodes as a supernova, it will shine as brightly as a **full moon** in the sky and be visible during the day for weeks or months.
2. **Shape**: Betelgeuse is not perfectly spherical. Observations show it has an irregular shape caused by **convective activity** and mass loss.
3. **Mass Loss**: Betelgeuse is shedding its outer layers at an incredible rate, forming a vast shell of gas and dust around it.

### **How to Observe Betelgeuse**
- **Location**: Betelgeuse is located in the **constellation Orion**, marking the **left shoulder of the hunter**.
- **Best Time to View**: Visible during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere (December through February).
- **Brightness**: Its variability makes it an interesting star to track over time!
