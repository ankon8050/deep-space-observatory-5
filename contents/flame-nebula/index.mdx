<Highlight title="The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)" subtitle="A Stunning Star-Forming Region in Orion" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Type**: Emission Nebula
- **Location**: Constellation **Orion**, near the easternmost star of Orion's Belt, **Alnitak** (Zeta Orionis).
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **1,350 light-years**.
- **Size**: Spans about **12 light-years** across.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: ~**2.0** (visible with telescopes and astrophotography).

---

### **Physical Characteristics**
- The Flame Nebula is part of the **Orion Molecular Cloud Complex**, a vast star-forming region that includes other famous objects like the **Orion Nebula (M42)** and the **Horsehead Nebula**.
- The nebula glows due to **ionized hydrogen gas**. The intense ultraviolet radiation from nearby stars, particularly **Alnitak**, excites the hydrogen gas, causing it to emit light.
- **Dark lanes of dust** run through the nebula, creating the appearance of "flames" when viewed in visible light.

---

### **Star Formation**
- The Flame Nebula is an **active star-forming region**, with numerous young stars embedded within its dense clouds of gas and dust.
- Observations in **infrared wavelengths** have revealed clusters of **protostars** hidden behind the nebula's thick dust clouds.
- The nebula is a prime target for studying the early stages of stellar evolution.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Best Time to View**: The Flame Nebula is best observed during **winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere, as Orion dominates the night sky from **December to February**.
- **Telescope Requirements**: While the Flame Nebula is faintly visible with small telescopes, its intricate details and "flame-like" structure are best captured through **long-exposure astrophotography**.
- **Nearby Objects**: The Flame Nebula is located close to the **Horsehead Nebula** and **Alnitak**, making it a popular target for wide-field astrophotography.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Alnitak's Role**: The bright star **Alnitak**, part of Orion's Belt, is the primary source of the ultraviolet radiation that illuminates the Flame Nebula.
2. **Infrared Observations**: The Flame Nebula is often studied in **infrared light**, which penetrates the dust clouds and reveals hidden stars and protostars.
3. **Part of a Larger Complex**: The Flame Nebula is just one of many fascinating objects in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, which is one of the closest and most active star-forming regions to Earth.

### **How to Locate the Flame Nebula**
- **Find Orion's Belt**: Locate the three bright stars of Orion's Belt in the night sky.
- **Look Near Alnitak**: The Flame Nebula is situated just to the east of **Alnitak**, the easternmost star in the Belt.
- **Use a Telescope**: A telescope with a wide field of view and a dark sky location will help you spot the nebula. For the best results, use filters designed for emission nebulae.

### **Personal Note**
Located 1,350 light years from the earth, is 6 light years from top to bottom,
lit by the star Alnitak located just below (visible) which is about 20 times
the size of the Sun and 33 times in mass. It is the left
most star of the Orion’s Belt (কালপুরুষের কোমরের বাম কোনার তারা)
