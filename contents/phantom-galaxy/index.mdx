<Highlight title="The Phantom Galaxy (Messier 74)" subtitle="A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy in Pisces" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Phantom Galaxy (Messier 74, M74, NGC 628)
- **Type**: Grand Design Spiral Galaxy
- **Location**: Constellation **Pisces**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **32 million light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: **9.4**, making it a relatively faint object for amateur astronomers.
- **Size**: Spans about **95,000 light-years**, slightly smaller than the Milky Way.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- The Phantom Galaxy is a **grand design spiral galaxy**, meaning it has well-defined and prominent spiral arms.
- It is viewed nearly face-on from Earth, providing a stunning view of its symmetrical structure.
- The galaxy is rich in **young, hot stars**, which illuminate its spiral arms, and contains regions of active star formation.
- Its core is relatively dim compared to other galaxies, which makes it challenging to observe with small telescopes.

---

### **Discovery and History**
- The Phantom Galaxy was discovered by **Pierre MÃ©chain** in 1780 and later included in **Charles Messier's catalog** of deep-sky objects.
- It has been extensively studied due to its nearly perfect spiral structure, making it a textbook example of a spiral galaxy.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Visibility**: The Phantom Galaxy is best observed in the **autumn months** in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Pisces is high in the sky.
- **Best Observing Tools**: A medium to large telescope is recommended to observe its faint details. Long-exposure astrophotography can reveal its intricate spiral arms.
- **Challenges**: Due to its low surface brightness, it is considered a difficult target for amateur astronomers without dark skies.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Star Formation**: The galaxy contains numerous **H II regions**, which are areas of ionized hydrogen gas where new stars are actively forming.
2. **Supernovae**: M74 has hosted several observed supernovae, making it an important galaxy for studying stellar evolution and death.
3. **Multi-Wavelength Observations**: Recent images from the **James Webb Space Telescope** and **Hubble Space Telescope** have revealed incredible details of the galaxy, including its star-forming regions and dust lanes.

### **How to Locate the Phantom Galaxy**
1. **Find Pisces**: Locate the faint constellation Pisces in the night sky. The Phantom Galaxy is situated near the star **Eta Piscium**.
2. **Use a Star Map**: A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint its exact location.
3. **Enhance Visibility**: Observing from a dark-sky location and using a telescope with a wide field of view will improve your chances of spotting this faint galaxy.

### **Personal Note**
This remarkable, albeit slightly hazy capture took a fabulous 33 minutes exposure. Considering
the amount of light pollution faced on the day, the image is at least distinguishable. Standing at
a massive distance of 35 million light years, the capture is my personal second most distant one.
When the galaxy was discovered initially in 2013, there was a supernova visible right next to it,
which was visible for 180 days. Unfortunately it is no longer there, but that does not mean we
cannot leave it to the imagination.
