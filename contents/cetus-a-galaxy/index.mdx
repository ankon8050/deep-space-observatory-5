<Highlight title="Cetus A (Messier 77)" subtitle="A Barred Spiral Galaxy in the Constellation Cetus" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Cetus A (Messier 77, M77, NGC 1068)
- **Type**: Barred Spiral Galaxy (Type SB)
- **Location**: Constellation **Cetus**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **47 million light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: **8.9**, making it visible with medium-sized telescopes.
- **Size**: Spans about **120,000 light-years**, slightly larger than the Milky Way.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- Messier 77 is a **barred spiral galaxy**, with a bright central region and well-defined spiral arms.
- It is classified as a **Seyfert galaxy**, meaning it has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by a supermassive black hole at its center.
- The galaxy emits strong radiation across multiple wavelengths, including visible light, X-rays, and radio waves.

---

### **Discovery**
- Messier 77 was discovered by **Pierre MÃ©chain** in 1780 and later added to Charles Messier's famous catalog of deep-sky objects.
- It was one of the first galaxies to be identified as having an active nucleus, making it a key object in the study of galactic evolution and black holes.

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Best Time to View**: Cetus A is best observed during **autumn and winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Cetus is prominent in the night sky.
- **Telescope Requirements**: A medium to large telescope is recommended to observe the galaxy's bright core and faint spiral arms.
- **Nearby Objects**: Messier 77 is located near other notable deep-sky objects in the constellation Cetus, making it a popular target for astrophotographers.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Active Galactic Nucleus**: The supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 77 is surrounded by a dense disk of gas and dust, which fuels its intense radiation.
2. **Star Formation**: The galaxy's spiral arms are rich in young, hot stars and regions of active star formation.
3. **Radio Source**: Messier 77 is a strong source of radio waves, earning it the designation "Cetus A."

### **How to Locate Cetus A**
1. **Find the Constellation Cetus**: Locate Cetus in the night sky, near other water-related constellations like Aquarius and Pisces.
2. **Use a Star Map**: Messier 77 is situated near the star Delta Ceti, making it easier to locate with a star map or app.
3. **Use a Telescope**: A telescope with a wide field of view will help you spot the galaxy's bright core. Larger telescopes can reveal its spiral structure.

### **Personal Note**
47 million light years away from earth. Meaning that we are seeing this galaxy as it was 47 million years ago.
There is no guarantee if the galaxy still exists or not.
