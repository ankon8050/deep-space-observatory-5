<Highlight title="The Owl Nebula (Messier 97)" subtitle="A Planetary Nebula in Ursa Major" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Owl Nebula (Messier 97, M97, NGC 3587)
- **Type**: Planetary Nebula
- **Location**: Constellation **Ursa Major**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **2,030 light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: **9.9**, making it a faint object best observed with a telescope.
- **Size**: Appears **3.2 arcminutes** in diameter, about ten times smaller than the Full Moon.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- The Owl Nebula is a **circular planetary nebula** with a faint internal structure that resembles the face of an owl, giving it its name.
- It is approximately **8,000 years old**, formed from the outer layers of a dying star that were ejected into space.
- The nebula's glow is caused by **ionized gases**, primarily hydrogen and oxygen, illuminated by the central white dwarf star.

### **Discovery**
- The Owl Nebula was discovered on **February 16, 1781**, by French astronomer **Pierre MÃ©chain**, a colleague of Charles Messier.
- The name "Owl Nebula" was later coined by **William Parsons**, the 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the nebula's owl-like appearance through his telescope.

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Best Time to View**: The Owl Nebula is best observed during **spring months** in the Northern Hemisphere when Ursa Major is high in the sky.
- **Telescope Requirements**: A medium to large telescope is needed to observe the nebula's faint details. Narrowband filters (e.g., H-alpha and OIII) can enhance its visibility.
- **Nearby Objects**: The Owl Nebula is located near the galaxy **Messier 108 (M108)**, making it a popular target for wide-field astrophotography.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Central Star**: The nebula's central star is a **white dwarf**, the remnant of the original star that shed its outer layers.
2. **Shape and Structure**: The nebula's circular shape and faint internal details make it one of the more visually interesting planetary nebulae.
3. **Historical Significance**: As one of the objects in the Messier Catalogue, the Owl Nebula has been studied extensively since its discovery.

### **How to Locate the Owl Nebula**
1. **Find Ursa Major**: Locate the constellation Ursa Major in the northern sky.
2. **Look Near the Big Dipper**: The Owl Nebula is situated near the "bowl" of the Big Dipper asterism.
3. **Use a Telescope**: A telescope with a wide field of view and dark skies will help you spot the nebula. Filters can enhance its visibility.
