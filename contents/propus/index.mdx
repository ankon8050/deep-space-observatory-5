<Highlight title="Propus (Eta Geminorum)" subtitle="A Triple Star System in Gemini" />

### **Basic Information**
- **Name**: Propus (Eta Geminorum)
- **Type**: Triple Star System
- **Location**: Constellation **Gemini**
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately **350 light-years**.
- **Apparent Magnitude**: **3.31**, making it visible to the naked eye under good conditions.

### **Physical Characteristics**
- **Primary Star**: The main component of Propus is a **red giant star** that has evolved off the main sequence. It is cooler and larger than the Sun.
- **Companions**: Propus is part of a **triple star system**, with two smaller companion stars orbiting the primary.
- The primary star is classified as a **semi-regular variable star**, meaning its brightness varies slightly over time.

---

### **Astronomical Significance**
- Propus is located near the **Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443)**, making it a useful reference point for locating the nebula in the night sky.
- It is part of the **Winter Hexagon**, a prominent asterism in the winter sky that includes other bright stars like Betelgeuse, Sirius, and Procyon.

---

### **Observational Highlights**
- **Visibility**: Propus is best observed during the **winter months** in the Northern Hemisphere when Gemini is high in the sky.
- **Color**: The red giant primary star gives Propus a distinct reddish hue, which can be observed through binoculars or a small telescope.
- **Nearby Objects**: The star is located near the bright stars **Castor** and **Pollux**, as well as the Jellyfish Nebula.

### **Interesting Facts**
1. **Variable Star**: The primary star's variability is caused by pulsations in its outer layers as it nears the end of its life.
2. **Name Origin**: The name "Propus" comes from the Greek word for "forward foot," as it represents the foot of one of the twins in the constellation Gemini.
3. **Triple System**: The gravitational interactions between the three stars in the system make it an interesting target for astronomers studying stellar dynamics.

### **How to Locate Propus**
1. **Find Gemini**: Locate the constellation Gemini in the night sky. Propus is near the "foot" of the twin represented by Pollux.
2. **Use Nearby Stars**: Look for the bright stars Castor and Pollux, and then trace downward to find Propus.
3. **Enhance Visibility**: Use binoculars or a small telescope to observe its reddish hue and nearby celestial objects.

### **Personal Note**
The star system was captured while viewing the Jellyfish nebula, which is also in the Gemini
constellation. The over exposure required for the Jellyfish nebula caused Propus to shine a bit
too bright than I would have preferred. Nevertheless, it was a good capture that came as a bonus.
