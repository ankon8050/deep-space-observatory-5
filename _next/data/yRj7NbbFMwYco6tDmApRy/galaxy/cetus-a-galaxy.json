{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"Cetus A (Messier 77)\" subtitle=\"A Barred Spiral Galaxy in the Constellation Cetus\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Cetus A (Messier 77, M77, NGC 1068)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Barred Spiral Galaxy (Type SB)</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Cetus</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>47 million light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>8.9</strong>, making it visible with medium-sized telescopes.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Spans about <strong>120,000 light-years</strong>, slightly larger than the Milky Way.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>Messier 77 is a <strong>barred spiral galaxy</strong>, with a bright central region and well-defined spiral arms.</li><li>It is classified as a <strong>Seyfert galaxy</strong>, meaning it has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by a supermassive black hole at its center.</li><li>The galaxy emits strong radiation across multiple wavelengths, including visible light, X-rays, and radio waves.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery</strong></h3><ul><li>Messier 77 was discovered by <strong>Pierre MÃ©chain</strong> in 1780 and later added to Charles Messier&#x27;s famous catalog of deep-sky objects.</li><li>It was one of the first galaxies to be identified as having an active nucleus, making it a key object in the study of galactic evolution and black holes.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: Cetus A is best observed during <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Cetus is prominent in the night sky.</li><li><strong>Telescope Requirements</strong>: A medium to large telescope is recommended to observe the galaxy&#x27;s bright core and faint spiral arms.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: Messier 77 is located near other notable deep-sky objects in the constellation Cetus, making it a popular target for astrophotographers.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Active Galactic Nucleus</strong>: The supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 77 is surrounded by a dense disk of gas and dust, which fuels its intense radiation.</li><li><strong>Star Formation</strong>: The galaxy&#x27;s spiral arms are rich in young, hot stars and regions of active star formation.</li><li><strong>Radio Source</strong>: Messier 77 is a strong source of radio waves, earning it the designation &quot;Cetus A.&quot;</li></ol><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a-1.JPG\" alt=\"The brightest dot in a larger chunk of the sky.\"/></p><h3><strong>How to Locate Cetus A</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find the Constellation Cetus</strong>: Locate Cetus in the night sky, near other water-related constellations like Aquarius and Pisces.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: Messier 77 is situated near the star Delta Ceti, making it easier to locate with a star map or app.</li><li><strong>Use a Telescope</strong>: A telescope with a wide field of view will help you spot the galaxy&#x27;s bright core. Larger telescopes can reveal its spiral structure.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>47 million light years away from earth. Meaning that we are seeing this galaxy as it was 47 million years ago.\nThere is no guarantee if the galaxy still exists or not.</p>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
