{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"Polaris (The North Star)\" subtitle=\"A Guiding Light in the Night Sky\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Polaris (also known as the North Star or Pole Star)</li><li><strong>Designation</strong>: Î± Ursae Minoris (Alpha Ursae Minoris)</li><li><strong>Constellation</strong>: Ursa Minor</li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>323 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: Fluctuates around <strong>1.98</strong>, making it the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Why is Polaris Important?</strong></h3><ul><li>Polaris is located <strong>almost directly above Earth&#x27;s north celestial pole</strong>, making it a critical reference point for navigation.</li><li>Unlike other stars, Polaris appears <strong>fixed in the night sky</strong>, as it aligns closely with Earth&#x27;s rotational axis. This makes it a reliable marker for finding true north.</li><li>Historically, Polaris has been used by travelers and sailors for centuries to navigate their way across land and sea.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>Polaris is a <strong>pulsating Cepheid variable star</strong>, meaning its brightness changes in a predictable cycle of about four days.</li><li>It is part of a <strong>multiple star system</strong>, with two smaller companion stars orbiting it.</li><li>The star&#x27;s surface is dynamic, with new research revealing that it is not static but has a pulsating and evolving surface.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>How to Find Polaris</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Locate the Big Dipper</strong>: Find the Big Dipper asterism in the northern sky.</li><li><strong>Use the Pointer Stars</strong>: The two stars at the end of the Big Dipper&#x27;s &quot;bowl&quot; (Dubhe and Merak) point directly to Polaris.</li><li><strong>Look for Ursa Minor</strong>: Polaris is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, marking the end of the Little Dipper&#x27;s handle.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Not Exactly at the Pole</strong>: Polaris does not sit precisely at the north celestial pole but is very close, within about <strong>0.7 degrees</strong>.</li><li><strong>Future Changes</strong>: Due to Earth&#x27;s axial precession, Polaris will not always be the North Star. In about 13,000 years, the star Vega in the constellation Lyra will take its place.</li><li><strong>Standard Candle</strong>: Polaris&#x27;s predictable brightness variations make it a &quot;standard candle&quot; for astronomers to measure distances in space.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Cultural Significance</strong></h3><ul><li>Polaris has been a symbol of <strong>guidance and constancy</strong> in many cultures.</li><li>It is often associated with navigation, hope, and direction, appearing in literature, folklore, and art.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: Polaris is visible year-round in the Northern Hemisphere.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: It is always found in the northern sky, making it a permanent fixture for stargazers.</li><li><strong>Telescope View</strong>: Through a telescope, you can observe Polaris&#x27;s companion stars, which are part of its multiple star system.</li></ul><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese","carolines-rose"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","owl-cluster"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/carolines-rose.jpg","title":"Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789) - A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/carolines-rose","slug":"carolines-rose"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":["first-quarter-moon","waxing-gibbous-moon","jupiter"],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
