{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Bow-Tie Nebula (NGC 40)\" subtitle=\"A Planetary Nebula in the Constellation Cepheus\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Bow-Tie Nebula (NGC 40), also known as Caldwell 2.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Planetary Nebula</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Cepheus</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>5,280 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>11.6</strong>, making it visible with medium-sized telescopes.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: About <strong>36 arcseconds</strong> in diameter.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Bow-Tie Nebula is a <strong>planetary nebula</strong>, formed when a dying star ejects its outer layers of gas into space.</li><li>The central star is a <strong>hot, dying star</strong> transitioning into a white dwarf. Its intense radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, causing it to glow.</li><li>The nebula has a distinctive <strong>bow-tie shape</strong>, with bright red and pink hues caused by ionized hydrogen and nitrogen gases.</li><li>The central star has a surface temperature of approximately <strong>50,000 Kelvin</strong>, making it extremely hot and luminous.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Bow-Tie Nebula was discovered by <strong>William Herschel</strong> on <strong>November 25, 1788</strong>.</li><li>It was cataloged as <strong>IV.58</strong> in Herschel&#x27;s deep-sky catalog and later included in the Caldwell catalog as Caldwell 2.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Best observed during the <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Cepheus is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: A medium to large telescope is recommended to resolve the nebula&#x27;s structure and colors. Narrowband filters (such as H-alpha) can enhance its visibility.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: The Bow-Tie Nebula is located in a rich star field in Cepheus, making it a great target for deep-sky observers.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Compact Size</strong>: The Bow-Tie Nebula is relatively small compared to other planetary nebulae, but its high surface brightness makes it stand out.</li><li><strong>Central Star</strong>: The central star is in the final stages of its life and will eventually cool into a white dwarf.</li><li><strong>Shape and Name</strong>: The nebula&#x27;s bow-tie or hourglass shape is caused by the interaction of stellar winds with the ejected material, creating a bipolar structure.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Bow-Tie Nebula</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Cepheus</strong>: Locate the constellation Cepheus in the northern sky. It is near the constellations Cassiopeia and Draco.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint the nebula&#x27;s exact location.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location and using a telescope with a wide aperture will improve your chances of seeing the nebula.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>A simple 10 minutes exposure was able to capture the brightness of this particular nebula,\nwhich is still being fuelled by its star of origin. This is the first capture of a planetary nebula,\nenabling me to learn about their specific characteristics. The actual object had to be zoomed in\nquite a lot, resulting in the surrounding stars to shine over bright in the image. At approximately\n1 light year in width, the nebula is very small compared to the visible portion of the sky.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula","fish-head-nebula","monkey-head-nebula","jellyfish-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["cepheus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bow-tie-nebula.jpg","title":"The Bow-Tie Nebula (NGC 40) - A Planetary Nebula in the Constellation Cepheus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/bow-tie-nebula","slug":"bow-tie-nebula"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula","fish-head-nebula","monkey-head-nebula","jellyfish-nebula"],"tags":["cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/crescent-nebula.jpg","title":"The Crescent Nebula (NGC 6888) - An Emission Nebula in the Constellation Cygnus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/crescent-nebula","slug":"crescent-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/fish-head-nebula.jpg","title":"The Fish Head Nebula (IC 1795)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/fish-head-nebula","slug":"fish-head-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","fish-head-nebula","orion-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/flame-nebula.jpg","title":"The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/flame-nebula","slug":"flame-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/horsehead-nebula.JPG","title":"The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/horsehead-nebula","slug":"horsehead-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula","fish-head-nebula","monkey-head-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["gemini-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/jellyfish-nebula.jpg","title":"The Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443) - A Supernova Remnant in Gemini","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/jellyfish-nebula","slug":"jellyfish-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula","fish-head-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/monkey-head-nebula.jpg","title":"The Monkey Head Nebula (NGC 2174)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/monkey-head-nebula","slug":"monkey-head-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula","owl-nebula"],"tags":["cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/north-american-nebula.jpg","title":"The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) - A Cosmic Cloud in the Shape of a Continent","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/north-america-nebula","slug":"north-america-nebula"}],"category":{"id":"nebula","title":"Nebula","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/nebula.JPG","description":"The darkest wonders of the cosmos"}},"__N_SSG":true}
