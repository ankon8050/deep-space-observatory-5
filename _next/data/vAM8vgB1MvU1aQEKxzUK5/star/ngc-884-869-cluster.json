{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884)\" subtitle=\"A Stunning Pair of Open Clusters in Perseus\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884), also known as <strong>Caldwell 14</strong>.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Open Star Clusters</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Perseus</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>7,600 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>5.3 (NGC 869)</strong> and <strong>6.1 (NGC 884)</strong>, making them visible to the naked eye under dark skies.</li><li><strong>Separation</strong>: The two clusters are separated by only <strong>half a degree</strong> in the sky.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Age</strong>: Both clusters are relatively young, estimated to be around <strong>14 million years old</strong>.</li><li><strong>Structure</strong>: The clusters are rich in bright, massive stars, many of which are blue supergiants, giving them a striking appearance.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Each cluster spans about <strong>70 light-years</strong> across.</li><li><strong>Brightness</strong>: The combined brightness of the clusters makes them a spectacular sight, even with small telescopes or binoculars.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Double Cluster has been known since antiquity and was first cataloged by <strong>Hipparchus</strong> in 130 BC.</li><li>Later, it was included in the <strong>New General Catalogue (NGC)</strong> by <strong>John Herschel</strong>.</li><li>The clusters are often referred to as <strong>h Persei (NGC 869)</strong> and <strong>Ï‡ (chi) Persei (NGC 884)</strong>.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: The Double Cluster is visible to the <strong>naked eye</strong> from dark locations and appears as a faint, hazy patch in the sky.</li><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: It is best observed during <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Perseus is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Telescope View</strong>: A small telescope or binoculars will reveal the individual stars in each cluster, while larger telescopes can show the intricate details of the star fields.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Proximity and Similarity</strong>: The Double Cluster is unique because of the close proximity and similar age of the two clusters, making them a rare and beautiful pair.</li><li><strong>Star Formation</strong>: Both clusters are part of the <strong>Perseus OB1 association</strong>, a region of active star formation.</li><li><strong>Cultural Significance</strong>: The Double Cluster has been admired for centuries and is often used as a benchmark for observing conditions due to its brightness and clarity.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Double Cluster</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find the Constellation Perseus</strong>: Look for Perseus in the northern sky, near the &quot;W&quot;-shaped constellation <strong>Cassiopeia</strong>.</li><li><strong>Look Between Cassiopeia and Perseus</strong>: The Double Cluster lies just east of Cassiopeia&#x27;s &quot;W&quot; asterism.</li><li><strong>Use Binoculars or a Telescope</strong>: While visible to the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view, revealing the individual stars in each cluster.</li></ol><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","related":["carolines-rose","sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["perseus-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/ngc-884-869-cluster.jpg","title":"The Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884) - A Stunning Pair of Open Clusters in Perseus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/ngc-884-869-cluster","slug":"ngc-884-869-cluster"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","owl-cluster"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/carolines-rose.jpg","title":"Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789) - A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/carolines-rose","slug":"carolines-rose"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese","carolines-rose"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":["first-quarter-moon","waxing-gibbous-moon","jupiter"],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
