{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"Caroline&#x27;s Rose Cluster (NGC 7789)\" subtitle=\"A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Caroline&#x27;s Rose Cluster (NGC 7789)</li><li><strong>Other Names</strong>: The White Rose Cluster, Herschel&#x27;s Spiral Cluster</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Open Star Cluster</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Cassiopeia</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>7,622 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>6.7</strong>, making it visible with binoculars and small telescopes.</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: Estimated to be around <strong>1.6 billion years old</strong>.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery</strong></h3><ul><li>Caroline&#x27;s Rose Cluster was discovered in <strong>1783</strong> by <strong>Caroline Herschel</strong>, a pioneering astronomer and comet-hunter.</li><li>Her brother, <strong>William Herschel</strong>, later included it in his catalog as <strong>H VI.30</strong>.</li><li>The cluster earned its nickname &quot;Caroline&#x27;s Rose&quot; because its loops of stars and dark lanes resemble the petals of a rose when viewed visually.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Structure</strong>: The cluster is unusually rich and densely packed with stars, creating a striking visual pattern of loops and dark voids that resemble a rose.</li><li><strong>Star Composition</strong>: The cluster contains a mix of white and yellow stars, which form intricate patterns resembling the borders of rose petals.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: The cluster spans about <strong>50 light-years</strong> across.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: Caroline&#x27;s Rose Cluster is best observed during <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Cassiopeia is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: It is visible with <strong>binoculars</strong> or a <strong>small telescope</strong> under dark skies. Larger telescopes can reveal its intricate structure and individual stars.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: Located in the rich star fields of Cassiopeia, it is surrounded by other notable deep-sky objects, making it a great target for stargazing.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Cultural Significance</strong>: The cluster is named after Caroline Herschel, one of the first women to make significant contributions to astronomy.</li><li><strong>Appearance</strong>: The dark lanes and loops of stars give the impression of a rose, making it one of the most visually striking open clusters.</li><li><strong>Age and Evolution</strong>: At 1.6 billion years old, the cluster is relatively old for an open cluster, and many of its original stars have already evolved into red giants.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate Caroline&#x27;s Rose Cluster</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Cassiopeia</strong>: Locate the &quot;W&quot;-shaped constellation Cassiopeia in the northern sky.</li><li><strong>Look Between Stars</strong>: The cluster is situated between the stars <strong>Ruchbah (Delta Cassiopeiae)</strong> and <strong>Beta Cassiopeiae</strong>.</li><li><strong>Use Binoculars or a Telescope</strong>: Even binoculars can reveal the cluster&#x27;s faint glow, while a telescope will show its intricate rose-like structure.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>The 17 minutes 30 seconds exposure managed to bring some fainter stars in the cluster, but\na few of the brighter ones became a bit too glazed. It was a bit challenging to capture the image\nsince confirmed count is about 2,799 stars in a span of 50 light years that is visible in the cluster\nfrom earth. Using a glare reducing filter may have produced a better result here. The geometric\npattern at the centre of the image roughly forms that of a rose, resulting to the cluster\ngetting its name as such.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/carolines-rose.jpg","title":"Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789) - A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/carolines-rose","slug":"carolines-rose"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","related":["carolines-rose","sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["perseus-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/ngc-884-869-cluster.jpg","title":"The Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884) - A Stunning Pair of Open Clusters in Perseus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/ngc-884-869-cluster","slug":"ngc-884-869-cluster"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":[],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
