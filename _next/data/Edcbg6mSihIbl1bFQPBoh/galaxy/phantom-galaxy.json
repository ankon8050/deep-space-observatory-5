{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Phantom Galaxy (Messier 74)\" subtitle=\"A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy in Pisces\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Phantom Galaxy (Messier 74, M74, NGC 628)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Grand Design Spiral Galaxy</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Pisces</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>32 million light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>9.4</strong>, making it a relatively faint object for amateur astronomers.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Spans about <strong>95,000 light-years</strong>, slightly smaller than the Milky Way.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Phantom Galaxy is a <strong>grand design spiral galaxy</strong>, meaning it has well-defined and prominent spiral arms.</li><li>It is viewed nearly face-on from Earth, providing a stunning view of its symmetrical structure.</li><li>The galaxy is rich in <strong>young, hot stars</strong>, which illuminate its spiral arms, and contains regions of active star formation.</li><li>Its core is relatively dim compared to other galaxies, which makes it challenging to observe with small telescopes.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Phantom Galaxy was discovered by <strong>Pierre MÃ©chain</strong> in 1780 and later included in <strong>Charles Messier&#x27;s catalog</strong> of deep-sky objects.</li><li>It has been extensively studied due to its nearly perfect spiral structure, making it a textbook example of a spiral galaxy.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: The Phantom Galaxy is best observed in the <strong>autumn months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when the constellation Pisces is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: A medium to large telescope is recommended to observe its faint details. Long-exposure astrophotography can reveal its intricate spiral arms.</li><li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Due to its low surface brightness, it is considered a difficult target for amateur astronomers without dark skies.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Star Formation</strong>: The galaxy contains numerous <strong>H II regions</strong>, which are areas of ionized hydrogen gas where new stars are actively forming.</li><li><strong>Supernovae</strong>: M74 has hosted several observed supernovae, making it an important galaxy for studying stellar evolution and death.</li><li><strong>Multi-Wavelength Observations</strong>: Recent images from the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope</strong> and <strong>Hubble Space Telescope</strong> have revealed incredible details of the galaxy, including its star-forming regions and dust lanes.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Phantom Galaxy</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Pisces</strong>: Locate the faint constellation Pisces in the night sky. The Phantom Galaxy is situated near the star <strong>Eta Piscium</strong>.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint its exact location.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location and using a telescope with a wide field of view will improve your chances of spotting this faint galaxy.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>This remarkable, albeit slightly hazy capture took a fabulous 33 minutes exposure. Considering\nthe amount of light pollution faced on the day, the image is at least distinguishable. Standing at\na massive distance of 35 million light years, the capture is my personal second most distant one.\nWhen the galaxy was discovered initially in 2013, there was a supernova visible right next to it,\nwhich was visible for 180 days. Unfortunately it is no longer there, but that does not mean we\ncannot leave it to the imagination.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["pisces-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/phantom-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Phantom Galaxy (Messier 74) - A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy in Pisces","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/phantom-galaxy","slug":"phantom-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-3.jpg","title":"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) - The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/andromeda-galaxy","slug":"andromeda-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
