M32 is a bright companion galaxy located just south of M31&#x27;s core.</li><li><strong>Use Binoculars or a Telescope</strong>: M32 is visible as a small, bright patch near the Andromeda Galaxy. A telescope will reveal its elliptical shape.</li><li><strong>Dark Skies</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location will enhance visibility and allow you to see M32 alongside M31 and another satellite galaxy, M110.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>When viewing the Le Gentil galaxy, I was not aware to the comparison it may hold with the\nAndromeda galaxy. Le Gentil galaxy is about 2.49 million light years away from the earth whereas\nthe Andromeda galaxy is about 2.53 million light years. While they are both in the Andromeda\nconstellation, it is safe to assume that the Le Genil galaxy is about 140,000 light years closer\nto our earth.</p><p>From the image, the small but bright speck of light is the Le Gentil galaxy, which is about 6,500\nlight years in diameter, meaning light takes 6,500 years to reach from one end of it to the other.\nThe large galaxy next to it is the Andromeda galaxy, which is about 150,000 light years in diameter.\nThe size comparison is the greatest observation from this simple capture from tonight.</p><p>Honestly, when viewing the Le Gentil galaxy, I had no idea that I would be capturing this great\nscale of comparison, but really glad that I managed to do it.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/le-gentil-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Le Gentil Galaxy (Messier 32) - A Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in the Andromeda Constellation","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/le-gentil-galaxy","slug":"le-gentil-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-3.jpg","title":"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) - The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/andromeda-galaxy","slug":"andromeda-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
