{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237)\" subtitle=\"A Stunning Star-Forming Region in Monoceros\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237), also known as <strong>Caldwell 49</strong>.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Emission Nebula and H II Region.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Monoceros</strong> (the Unicorn).</li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>5,000 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Spans about <strong>100 light-years</strong> across.</li><li><strong>Associated Cluster</strong>: The open star cluster <strong>NGC 2244</strong> (Caldwell 50) is embedded within the nebula.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Rosette Nebula is a <strong>giant molecular cloud</strong> and a prominent <strong>star-forming region</strong>.</li><li>It is composed of <strong>ionized hydrogen gas (H II region)</strong>, which glows due to the intense ultraviolet radiation from the young, massive stars in the central cluster.</li><li>The nebula&#x27;s intricate structure and floral appearance are shaped by stellar winds and radiation from the stars within it.</li><li>The open cluster <strong>NGC 2244</strong> was formed from the nebula&#x27;s material and continues to illuminate it.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Rosette Nebula was discovered in parts, with its various regions cataloged under different NGC numbers (NGC 2237, 2238, 2239, and 2246).</li><li>It was later recognized as a single, unified nebula.</li><li>Its name comes from its <strong>rose-like appearance</strong>, which is especially striking in astrophotography.</li></ul><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/rosette-nebula-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image edited by expanding the colour spectrum.\"/>\nImage edited by expanding the colour spectrum, but was disrupted a bit by the noise caused by light pollution.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Best observed during the <strong>winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Monoceros is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: A small telescope or binoculars can reveal the open cluster NGC 2244, while the nebula itself is best seen with a wide-field telescope and filters (such as H-alpha or OIII).</li><li><strong>Astrophotography</strong>: The Rosette Nebula is a popular target for astrophotographers due to its vibrant colors and intricate structure.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Star Formation</strong>: The Rosette Nebula is an active star-forming region, with new stars being born from its dense molecular clouds.</li><li><strong>Size and Scale</strong>: At 100 light-years across, the nebula is large enough to span several full moons in the sky.</li><li><strong>Ionization</strong>: The nebula&#x27;s glow is caused by ionized hydrogen gas, which emits light when energized by the radiation from the central stars.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Rosette Nebula</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Monoceros</strong>: Locate the faint constellation Monoceros, which lies near Orion and Canis Major.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: The Rosette Nebula is located near the bright star <strong>Betelgeuse</strong> in Orion and the star <strong>Procyon</strong> in Canis Minor.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location and using narrowband filters will enhance the nebula&#x27;s visibility.</li></ol><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/rosette-nebula-2.JPG\" alt=\"Original capture.\"/></p><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>A particular fascination of my wife, this was my third attempt to capture the glorious nebula,\nwhich resembles somewhat of a rose. Not sure if the name came from that. The original image, as\nabove, took about 75 minutes of exposure, but still due to the immense light pollution, I did\nnot manage to get anything clearer. Using three astrophoto editing tools, viz. GraXpert, Siril\nand GIMP, I managed to extract a few variations. This would mark my first successful editing of\nan image, after hours of training online.</p>","data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","fish-head-nebula","orion-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["monoceros-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/rosette-nebula.jpg","title":"The Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237) - A Stunning Star-Forming Region in Monoceros","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/rosette-nebula","slug":"rosette-nebula"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula","fish-head-nebula","monkey-head-nebula","jellyfish-nebula"],"tags":["cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/crescent-nebula.jpg","title":"The Crescent Nebula (NGC 6888) - An Emission Nebula in the Constellation Cygnus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/crescent-nebula","slug":"crescent-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/fish-head-nebula.jpg","title":"The Fish Head Nebula (IC 1795)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/fish-head-nebula","slug":"fish-head-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","fish-head-nebula","orion-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/flame-nebula-3.jpg","title":"The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) - A Stunning Star-Forming Region in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/flame-nebula","slug":"flame-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/horsehead-nebula-3.jpg","title":"The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) - An Iconic Dark Nebula in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/horsehead-nebula","slug":"horsehead-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula","owl-nebula"],"tags":["cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/north-america-nebula-1.png","title":"The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) - A Cosmic Cloud in the Shape of a Continent","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/north-america-nebula","slug":"north-america-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula","owl-nebula","fish-head-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/orion-nebula-3.jpg","title":"The Orion Nebula (Messier 42) - A Stellar Nursery in the Constellation Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/orion-nebula","slug":"orion-nebula"}],"category":{"id":"nebula","title":"Nebula","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/nebula.JPG","description":"The darkest wonders of the cosmos"}},"__N_SSG":true}
