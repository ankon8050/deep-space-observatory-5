{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Owl Nebula (Messier 97)\" subtitle=\"A Planetary Nebula in Ursa Major\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Owl Nebula (Messier 97, M97, NGC 3587)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Planetary Nebula</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Ursa Major</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>2,030 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>9.9</strong>, making it a faint object best observed with a telescope.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Appears <strong>3.2 arcminutes</strong> in diameter, about ten times smaller than the Full Moon.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Owl Nebula is a <strong>circular planetary nebula</strong> with a faint internal structure that resembles the face of an owl, giving it its name.</li><li>It is approximately <strong>8,000 years old</strong>, formed from the outer layers of a dying star that were ejected into space.</li><li>The nebula&#x27;s glow is caused by <strong>ionized gases</strong>, primarily hydrogen and oxygen, illuminated by the central white dwarf star.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery</strong></h3><ul><li>The Owl Nebula was discovered on <strong>February 16, 1781</strong>, by French astronomer <strong>Pierre MÃ©chain</strong>, a colleague of Charles Messier.</li><li>The name &quot;Owl Nebula&quot; was later coined by <strong>William Parsons</strong>, the 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the nebula&#x27;s owl-like appearance through his telescope.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: The Owl Nebula is best observed during <strong>spring months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Ursa Major is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Telescope Requirements</strong>: A medium to large telescope is needed to observe the nebula&#x27;s faint details. Narrowband filters (e.g., H-alpha and OIII) can enhance its visibility.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: The Owl Nebula is located near the galaxy <strong>Messier 108 (M108)</strong>, making it a popular target for wide-field astrophotography.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Central Star</strong>: The nebula&#x27;s central star is a <strong>white dwarf</strong>, the remnant of the original star that shed its outer layers.</li><li><strong>Shape and Structure</strong>: The nebula&#x27;s circular shape and faint internal details make it one of the more visually interesting planetary nebulae.</li><li><strong>Historical Significance</strong>: As one of the objects in the Messier Catalogue, the Owl Nebula has been studied extensively since its discovery.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Owl Nebula</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Ursa Major</strong>: Locate the constellation Ursa Major in the northern sky.</li><li><strong>Look Near the Big Dipper</strong>: The Owl Nebula is situated near the &quot;bowl&quot; of the Big Dipper asterism.</li><li><strong>Use a Telescope</strong>: A telescope with a wide field of view and dark skies will help you spot the nebula. Filters can enhance its visibility.</li></ol><hr/>","data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/owl-nebula.jpg","title":"The Owl Nebula (Messier 97)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/owl-nebula","slug":"owl-nebula"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":[],"tags":["orion-constellation","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/flame-nebula.jpg","title":"The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/flame-nebula","slug":"flame-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/horsehead-nebula.JPG","title":"The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/horsehead-nebula","slug":"horsehead-nebula"}],"category":{"id":"nebula","title":"Nebula","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/nebula.JPG","description":"The darkest wonders of the cosmos"}},"__N_SSG":true}
