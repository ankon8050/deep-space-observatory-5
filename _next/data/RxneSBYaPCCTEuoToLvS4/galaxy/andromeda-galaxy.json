{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31)\" subtitle=\"The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31, M31, NGC 224)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Barred Spiral Galaxy</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Andromeda</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>2.537 million light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>3.4</strong>, making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Spans about <strong>152,000 light-years</strong>, making it slightly larger than the Milky Way.</li><li><strong>Initial Observation</strong>: 2nd January 2025</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Andromeda Galaxy is a <strong>barred spiral galaxy</strong>, similar in structure to the Milky Way, with a bright central core and well-defined spiral arms.</li><li>It contains an estimated <strong>1 trillion stars</strong>, more than double the number in the Milky Way.</li><li>The galaxy is surrounded by a halo of dark matter and several satellite galaxies, including <strong>Messier 32 (M32)</strong> and <strong>Messier 110 (M110)</strong>.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Andromeda Galaxy was first cataloged by <strong>Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi</strong> in 964 AD in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars,&quot; where he described it as a &quot;small cloud.&quot;</li><li>It was later observed by <strong>Simon Marius</strong> in 1612, who described it as a nebula.</li><li>In the 20th century, <strong>Edwin Hubble</strong> confirmed that Andromeda was not a nebula within the Milky Way but a separate galaxy, marking a pivotal moment in our understanding of the universe.</li></ul><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy.jpg\" alt=\"Original capture.\"/></p><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: The Andromeda Galaxy is visible to the <strong>naked eye</strong> as a faint, elongated smudge in dark skies.</li><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: It is best observed during <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere.</li><li><strong>Telescope View</strong>: A small telescope or binoculars can reveal its bright core and some of its spiral structure. Larger telescopes can show its satellite galaxies, M32 and M110.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Closest Major Galaxy</strong>: Andromeda is the closest large galaxy to the Milky Way, though several smaller galaxies, such as the Magellanic Clouds, are closer.</li><li><strong>Future Collision</strong>: Andromeda and the Milky Way are on a collision course and are expected to merge in about <strong>4.5 billion years</strong>, forming a new galaxy often referred to as &quot;Milkomeda.&quot;</li><li><strong>Gigapixel Image</strong>: The Hubble Space Telescope captured a <strong>1.5 billion-pixel image</strong> of the Andromeda Galaxy, one of the largest and most detailed images ever taken of a galaxy.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Andromeda Galaxy</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find the Constellation Andromeda</strong>: Look for the constellation Andromeda, which is located near <strong>Pegasus</strong> and <strong>Cassiopeia</strong> in the northern sky.</li><li><strong>Use Star Chains</strong>: Start at the star <strong>Alpheratz</strong> in Pegasus, move to <strong>Mirach</strong> (Beta Andromedae), and then to <strong>Mu Andromedae</strong>, which points directly to the galaxy.</li><li><strong>Use Binoculars or a Telescope</strong>: While visible to the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope will enhance its appearance and reveal more details.</li></ol><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-2.jpg\" alt=\"Andromeda galaxy shining brightest.\"/></p><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>Being the closest galaxy to our own Milky Way, the clear image required only an exposure of 15 minutes\nand 50 seconds, proving how close it is to us. While 2.5 million light years still sound quite high,\nits apparent collision trajectory with the Milky Way designates that this distance is quite small to\nthe vastness of the entire cosmos. The Andromeda Galaxy is again larger than the Milky Way and thus,\ncontaining more stars. Limitations of human capability has not enabled us to take a full picture of\nthe Milky Way, but such a beautiful image of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own backyard brings to\nthe imagination how beautiful our own Milky Way Galaxy might be.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["whirlpool-galaxy","cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-3.jpg","title":"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) - The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/andromeda-galaxy","slug":"andromeda-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/le-gentil-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Le Gentil Galaxy (Messier 32) - A Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in the Andromeda Constellation","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/le-gentil-galaxy","slug":"le-gentil-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","related":["andromeda-galaxy","cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["canes-venatici-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/whirlpool-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) - A Grand-Design Spiral Galaxy in Canes Venatici","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/whirlpool-galaxy","slug":"whirlpool-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
