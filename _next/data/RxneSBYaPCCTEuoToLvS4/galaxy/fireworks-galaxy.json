{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Fireworks Galaxy (NGC 6946)\" subtitle=\"A Spiral Galaxy on the Cepheus-Cygnus Border\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Fireworks Galaxy (NGC 6946)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Intermediate Spiral Galaxy</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Straddles the boundary between the constellations <strong>Cepheus</strong> and <strong>Cygnus</strong>.</li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>22 to 25.2 million light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>9.6</strong>, making it visible with medium-sized telescopes.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Spans about <strong>40,000 light-years</strong>, which is smaller than the Milky Way.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Fireworks Galaxy is a <strong>face-on spiral galaxy</strong>, meaning it is oriented such that we see its disk from above, providing a clear view of its spiral structure.</li><li>It has a <strong>small, bright nucleus</strong> and well-defined spiral arms rich in star-forming regions.</li><li>The galaxy is known for its <strong>high rate of supernovae</strong>, with at least <strong>10 supernovae</strong> observed in the past century, earning it the nickname &quot;Fireworks Galaxy.&quot;</li><li>Its spiral arms are filled with <strong>young, hot stars</strong>, glowing gas, and dust, making it a vibrant and active galaxy.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Fireworks Galaxy was discovered by <strong>William Herschel</strong> on <strong>September 9, 1798</strong>.</li><li>It has been extensively studied due to its high supernova activity and its location near the plane of the Milky Way, which makes it partially obscured by interstellar dust.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Best observed during the <strong>summer and autumn months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Cepheus and Cygnus are high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: A medium to large telescope is recommended to resolve its spiral structure. Long-exposure astrophotography can reveal its intricate details and vibrant star-forming regions.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: The galaxy is located in a rich star field near the Milky Way&#x27;s plane, making it a visually stunning region for observation.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Supernova Factory</strong>: The Fireworks Galaxy has one of the highest rates of supernovae observed in any galaxy, with 10 supernovae recorded in the last century.</li><li><strong>Star Formation</strong>: Its spiral arms are active regions of star formation, glowing brightly in ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths.</li><li><strong>Cosmic Neighborhood</strong>: NGC 6946 is located near the Milky Way&#x27;s plane, which makes it partially obscured by interstellar dust but also places it in a visually rich region of the sky.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Fireworks Galaxy</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Cepheus and Cygnus</strong>: Locate the constellations Cepheus and Cygnus in the night sky. The Fireworks Galaxy lies near their boundary.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint its exact location.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location and using a telescope with a wide aperture will improve your chances of seeing the galaxy.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>Trying to quench my fascination to see galaxies that are way over a million light years away, the\nFireworks galaxy becomes the next member of collection. Unfortunately, the light pollution in\nthe surroundings disrupted the image capture process quite a lot, even though there was a 52\nmintues exposure. Possibly some day, we may try to go to a more isolated location and get a more\nclear image.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cepheus-constellation","cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/fireworks-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Fireworks Galaxy (NGC 6946) - A Spiral Galaxy on the Cepheus-Cygnus Border","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/fireworks-galaxy","slug":"fireworks-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["whirlpool-galaxy","cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-3.jpg","title":"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) - The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/andromeda-galaxy","slug":"andromeda-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/le-gentil-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Le Gentil Galaxy (Messier 32) - A Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in the Andromeda Constellation","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/le-gentil-galaxy","slug":"le-gentil-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
