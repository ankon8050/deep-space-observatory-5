{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Waxing Gibbous Moon\" subtitle=\"An Intermediate Phase of the Lunar Cycle\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Waxing Gibbous Moon</li><li><strong>Phase</strong>: Intermediate phase between the <strong>First Quarter Moon</strong> and the <strong>Full Moon</strong>.</li><li><strong>Illumination</strong>: The Moon&#x27;s illumination increases from <strong>50.1% to 99.9%</strong> during this phase.</li><li><strong>Appearance</strong>: More than half of the Moon&#x27;s surface is illuminated, but it is not yet fully lit.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Waxing Gibbous Moon is visible in the <strong>afternoon and early evening</strong>, lighting up the sky before it gets completely dark.</li><li>It sets <strong>after midnight</strong>, making it a prominent feature of the night sky.</li><li>The Moon does not emit its own light but shines by reflecting sunlight. During this phase, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are positioned such that most of the Moon&#x27;s near side is illuminated.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Astronomical Context</strong></h3><ul><li>This phase occurs as the Moon moves in its orbit around Earth, transitioning from the <strong>First Quarter</strong> to the <strong>Full Moon</strong>.</li><li>The term &quot;waxing&quot; refers to the increasing illumination of the Moon, while &quot;gibbous&quot; describes its bulging, convex shape.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Symbolism</strong>: The Waxing Gibbous Moon is often associated with growth, refinement, and preparation, symbolizing the final stages before completion (represented by the Full Moon).</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: This phase lasts for about <strong>3 to 4 days</strong>.</li><li><strong>Observation from Space</strong>: The Waxing Gibbous Moon has been photographed from the International Space Station, providing stunning views of its illuminated surface.</li></ol><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/waxing-gibbous-01.jpg\" alt=\"Two days later - waxing gibbous moon.\"/></p><h3><strong>How to Observe the Waxing Gibbous Moon</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Timing</strong>: Look for the Waxing Gibbous Moon in the sky during the late afternoon and early evening. It will remain visible until after midnight.</li><li><strong>Telescope Viewing</strong>: This phase is ideal for observing the Moon&#x27;s surface features, such as craters and mountain ranges, as the shadows cast by the Sun highlight the terrain.</li><li><strong>Photography</strong>: The Waxing Gibbous Moon is a great target for astrophotographers due to its brightness and detailed surface features.</li></ol><hr/>","data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","jupiter","mars","first-quarter-moon"],"tags":["solar-system","moon"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/waxing-gibbous-moon.jpg","title":"The Waxing Gibbous Moon - January 10, 2025","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/waxing-gibbous-moon","slug":"waxing-gibbous-moon"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2025-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","jupiter","mars","waxing-gibbous-moon"],"tags":["solar-system","moon"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/first-quarter-moon-2.jpg","title":"The First Quarter Moon - January 6, 2025","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/first-quarter-moon","slug":"first-quarter-moon"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","mars"],"tags":["planet"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/jupiter.jpg","title":"Jupiter - The Largest Planet in the Solar System","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/jupiter","slug":"jupiter"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","jupiter"],"tags":["planet"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/mars.jpg","title":"Mars - The Red Planet","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/mars","slug":"mars"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":[],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"solar-system","title":"Solar System","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","description":"Mysteries of the Solar System"}},"__N_SSG":true}
