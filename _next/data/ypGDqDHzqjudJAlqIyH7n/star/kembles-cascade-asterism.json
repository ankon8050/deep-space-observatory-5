{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"Kemble&#x27;s Cascade Asterism\" subtitle=\"A Stunning Line of Stars in Camelopardalis\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Kemble&#x27;s Cascade (Kemble 1)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Asterism (a pattern of unrelated stars)</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Camelopardalis</strong></li><li><strong>Length</strong>: Spans approximately <strong>3 degrees</strong> of the night sky (about five times the diameter of the full Moon).</li><li><strong>Stars</strong>: Composed of more than <strong>20 stars</strong> ranging in magnitude from <strong>5th to 10th</strong>.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>Kemble&#x27;s Cascade appears as a <strong>straight line of stars</strong> running from <strong>northwest to southeast</strong>.</li><li>The stars in the asterism are not physically related but are a <strong>chance alignment</strong> of stars at varying distances from Earth.</li><li>The cascade ends at the <strong>open cluster NGC 1502</strong>, which adds to its visual appeal.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>Kemble&#x27;s Cascade was discovered by <strong>Father Lucian Kemble</strong>, a Canadian amateur astronomer and Franciscan friar.</li><li>He described it as a &quot;beautiful cascade of faint stars tumbling from the northwest down to NGC 1502.&quot;</li><li>The asterism was later popularized by <strong>Walter Scott Houston</strong>, who wrote about it in his astronomy column.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Best observed during the <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: Binoculars or a small telescope are ideal for viewing the cascade, as it spans a wide area of the sky.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: The asterism ends at the small open cluster <strong>NGC 1502</strong>, which is a great target for telescopic observation.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Colorful Stars</strong>: The stars in Kemble&#x27;s Cascade are known for their varying colors, making it a visually stunning sight.</li><li><strong>Asterism, Not a Constellation</strong>: Like the Big Dipper, Kemble&#x27;s Cascade is an asterism, meaning it is a recognizable pattern of stars but not an official constellation.</li><li><strong>Unique Alignment</strong>: The straight-line appearance of the stars is a rare and beautiful chance alignment.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate Kemble&#x27;s Cascade</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Camelopardalis</strong>: Locate the faint constellation Camelopardalis in the northern sky. It lies near Cassiopeia and Perseus.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: Start from the bright star <strong>Beta Cassiopeiae (Caph)</strong> in Cassiopeia and sweep eastward to locate the cascade.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location with binoculars will reveal the full extent of the cascade and its colorful stars.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>This is my first capture of an Asterism, which is a new term that I learned through this capture.\nWhile constellations are well-defined pattern of stars that are recognised by the IAU authority,\nasterisms are unlisted, but recognisable pattern of stars that can be observed in the night sky.\nThe term may hold theoretical significance, while in real-view, it may as well be a cluster of\nstars.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","carolines-rose","owl-cluster"],"tags":["camelopardalis-constellation","asterism"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/kembles-cascade-asterism.jpg","title":"Kemble's Cascade Asterism - A Stunning Line of Stars in Camelopardalis","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/kembles-cascade-asterism","slug":"kembles-cascade-asterism"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","owl-cluster"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/carolines-rose.jpg","title":"Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789) - A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/carolines-rose","slug":"carolines-rose"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","related":["carolines-rose","sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["perseus-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/ngc-884-869-cluster.jpg","title":"The Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884) - A Stunning Pair of Open Clusters in Perseus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/ngc-884-869-cluster","slug":"ngc-884-869-cluster"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","carolines-rose","kembles-cascade-asterism"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/owl-cluster.jpg","title":"The Owl Cluster (NGC 457) - A Bright Open Star Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/owl-cluster","slug":"owl-cluster"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":[],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
