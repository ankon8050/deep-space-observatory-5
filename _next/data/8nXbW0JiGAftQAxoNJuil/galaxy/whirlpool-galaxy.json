Use the handle of the Big Dipper as a guide.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: The Whirlpool Galaxy is located near the star <strong>Alkaid</strong>, the end star of the Big Dipper&#x27;s handle.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location with a telescope or binoculars will help reveal the galaxy and its companion.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>It took a while to upload this particular capture. The interesting fact about the Whirlpool galaxy\nis that, the bright cosmic structure seen right next to it, is another galaxy titled NGC 5195. In\nthe vast cosmos, the NGC 5195 has been pulled close to the Whirlpool galaxy and is gravitationally\ninteracting with it, much like making it a dual galaxy system. The pull from NGC 5195 has caused\nthe arms of the Whirlpool galaxy to be stretched, as seen in the image. Current research shows that\nthe NGC 5195 is passing behind the Whirlpool galaxy, which may become abundant to humans in a few\nhundreds of thousands of years. Perhaps that will give the future humans a good idea on what will\nhappen when our Milky Way galaxy will collide with the Andromeda galaxy.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","related":["andromeda-galaxy","cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["canes-venatici-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/whirlpool-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) - A Grand-Design Spiral Galaxy in Canes Venatici","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/whirlpool-galaxy","slug":"whirlpool-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["whirlpool-galaxy","cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-4.jpg","title":"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) - The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/andromeda-galaxy","slug":"andromeda-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/le-gentil-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Le Gentil Galaxy (Messier 32) - A Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in the Andromeda Constellation","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/le-gentil-galaxy","slug":"le-gentil-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
