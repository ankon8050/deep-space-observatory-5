{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)\" subtitle=\"A Starburst Galaxy in Ursa Major\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Type</strong>: Starburst galaxy (Irr2, irregular galaxy)</li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>12 million light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Found in the constellation <strong>Ursa Major</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: ~<strong>8.4</strong> (bright enough to observe with small telescopes).</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: Roughly <strong>37,000 light-years in diameter</strong> (much smaller than the Milky Way).</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Why is it called the Cigar Galaxy?</strong></h3><p>The galaxy earned its nickname due to its <strong>elongated, cigar-like shape</strong> when viewed from Earth. It appears edge-on, giving it a stretched appearance.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Starburst Activity</strong></h3><ul><li>M82 is classified as a <strong>starburst galaxy</strong>, meaning it is undergoing an intense period of <strong>star formation</strong>, producing stars at a rate 10 times faster than that of the Milky Way.</li><li>This starburst activity is triggered by gravitational interactions with its neighboring galaxy, <strong>Messier 81 (M81)</strong>.</li><li>The tidal forces from this interaction have disrupted M82&#x27;s structure, compressing gas and dust to fuel the birth of new stars.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Superwind Phenomenon</strong></h3><p>One of the most striking features of the Cigar Galaxy is its <strong>superwind</strong>:</p><ul><li>Powerful winds, driven by supernova explosions and stellar winds from massive stars, are pushing gas and dust out of the galaxy.</li><li>These superwinds form <strong>red filamentary structures</strong> of hydrogen gas that extend thousands of light-years from the galaxy&#x27;s core. This phenomenon is visible in infrared and X-ray wavelengths.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Infrared Brightness</strong>: M82 is the brightest galaxy in the sky in the <strong>infrared spectrum</strong>, making it an interesting object for astronomers studying star formation.</li><li><strong>X-ray Emissions</strong>: The galaxy is a strong source of X-rays due to the high-energy events occurring in its core and superwind regions.</li><li><strong>Companion Galaxy</strong>: M82 is gravitationally bound to <strong>Messier 81 (Bode&#x27;s Galaxy)</strong>, a nearby spiral galaxy. Together, they form a beautiful pair of galaxies often studied together.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>How to Observe the Cigar Galaxy</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: Visible from <strong>late winter to early spring</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere.</li><li><strong>Telescope</strong>: Small telescopes can reveal its cigar-like shape, while larger telescopes and long-exposure astrophotography can unveil details like its filamentary superwind structures.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Fun Fact</strong></h3><p>The Cigar Galaxy was home to a <strong>Type Ia supernova (SN 2014J)</strong>, discovered in January 2014. This supernova became one of the closest and brightest supernovae observed in recent years, making M82 even more famous in the astronomical community.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cigar-galaxy.jpg","title":"The Cigar Galaxy (Messier 82, M82)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cigar-galaxy","slug":"cigar-galaxy"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","related":["whirlpool-galaxy","cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy","le-gentil-galaxy"],"tags":["andromeda-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/andromeda-galaxy-4.jpg","title":"The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) - The Closest Major Galaxy to the Milky Way","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/andromeda-galaxy","slug":"andromeda-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy","cetus-a-galaxy"],"tags":["ursa-major-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/bodes-galaxy.png","title":"Bode's Galaxy (Messier 81, M81)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/bodes-galaxy","slug":"bodes-galaxy"},{"data":{"category":"galaxy","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["cigar-galaxy","bodes-galaxy","andromeda-galaxy"],"tags":["cetus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/cetus-a.jpg","title":"Cetus A (Messier 77)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/galaxy/cetus-a-galaxy","slug":"cetus-a-galaxy"}],"category":{"id":"galaxy","title":"Galaxy","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/galaxy.jpg","description":"Specks in the night sky harbouring millions and billions of stars"}},"__N_SSG":true}
