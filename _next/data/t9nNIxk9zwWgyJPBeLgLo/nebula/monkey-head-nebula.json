{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Monkey Head Nebula (NGC 2174)\" subtitle=\"A Stellar Nursery in the Constellation Orion\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Monkey Head Nebula (NGC 2174), also known as Sharpless Sh2-252.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: H II Emission Nebula</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Orion</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>6,400 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Associated Cluster</strong>: The nebula is associated with the open star cluster <strong>NGC 2175</strong>.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Monkey Head Nebula is a <strong>stellar nursery</strong>, a region of active star formation where young stars are born from collapsing clouds of gas and dust.</li><li>It features <strong>pillars of gas and dust</strong>, sculpted by the intense radiation and stellar winds from massive young stars embedded within the nebula.</li><li>The nebula glows brightly due to the ionization of hydrogen gas by ultraviolet radiation from these young stars, creating its characteristic emission nebula appearance.</li><li>The intricate structure of the nebula, including its &quot;monkey head&quot; shape, is a result of the interplay between gravity, radiation, and stellar winds.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Monkey Head Nebula was discovered on <strong>February 6, 1877</strong>, by French astronomer <strong>Ã‰douard Stephan</strong>.</li><li>It has been extensively studied and imaged, including by the <strong>Hubble Space Telescope</strong>, which captured stunning infrared and visible-light images of the nebula.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: The Monkey Head Nebula is located in the constellation Orion, making it visible during <strong>winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: A telescope with a wide field of view and narrowband filters (such as H-alpha) is ideal for observing the nebula&#x27;s intricate details and vibrant colors.</li><li><strong>Astrophotography</strong>: The nebula is a popular target for astrophotographers due to its striking appearance and the dramatic contrast between its bright regions and dark dust lanes.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Star Formation</strong>: The nebula is home to many young, massive stars that are still forming within dense molecular clouds.</li><li><strong>Hubble Observations</strong>: The Hubble Space Telescope has captured detailed images of the nebula, revealing its carved knots of gas and dust and the young stars embedded within.</li><li><strong>Shape and Name</strong>: The nebula&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Monkey Head,&quot; comes from its resemblance to the shape of a monkey&#x27;s head in visible-light images.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Monkey Head Nebula</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Orion</strong>: Locate the constellation Orion in the night sky. The nebula is situated near the northern edge of Orion, close to the border with Gemini.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: The nebula is faint and requires a telescope to observe. Use a star map or app to pinpoint its exact location.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Narrowband filters, such as H-alpha, can enhance the nebula&#x27;s visibility by highlighting its glowing hydrogen gas.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>The nebula represents the side face of a monkey&#x27;s head and thus, the name. If observed closely,\nit should be possible to distinguish the elevated mouth-like structure on the right. The 50 minutes\nexposure was able to bring out the distinct outline of the nebula.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula","fish-head-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/monkey-head-nebula.jpg","title":"The Monkey Head Nebula (NGC 2174)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/monkey-head-nebula","slug":"monkey-head-nebula"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/fish-head-nebula.jpg","title":"The Fish Head Nebula (IC 1795)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/fish-head-nebula","slug":"fish-head-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","fish-head-nebula","orion-nebula","crescent-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/flame-nebula.jpg","title":"The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/flame-nebula","slug":"flame-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/horsehead-nebula.JPG","title":"The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/horsehead-nebula","slug":"horsehead-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula","owl-nebula"],"tags":["cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/north-american-nebula.jpg","title":"The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) - A Cosmic Cloud in the Shape of a Continent","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/north-america-nebula","slug":"north-america-nebula"}],"category":{"id":"nebula","title":"Nebula","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/nebula.JPG","description":"The darkest wonders of the cosmos"}},"__N_SSG":true}
