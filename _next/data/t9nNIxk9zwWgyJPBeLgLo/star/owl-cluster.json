{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"The Owl Cluster (NGC 457)\" subtitle=\"A Bright Open Star Cluster in Cassiopeia\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Owl Cluster (NGC 457), also known as the <strong>E.T. Cluster</strong>.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Open Star Cluster</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Cassiopeia</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>7,900 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>6.4</strong>, making it visible with binoculars and small telescopes.</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: Estimated to be around <strong>20 million years old</strong>.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li>The Owl Cluster is a <strong>young open star cluster</strong>, containing a mix of bright and faint stars.</li><li>Two prominent stars, <strong>Phi Cassiopeiae</strong> (magnitude 5) and <strong>HD 7902</strong> (magnitude 7), are often imagined as the &quot;eyes&quot; of the owl, giving the cluster its name.</li><li>The cluster spans about <strong>13 arcminutes</strong> in the sky and contains over <strong>100 stars</strong>, many of which are hot, blue stars typical of young clusters.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Discovery and History</strong></h3><ul><li>The Owl Cluster was discovered by <strong>William Herschel</strong> on <strong>August 18, 1780</strong>, using a 6.2-inch reflector telescope.</li><li>It was cataloged as <strong>VII 42</strong> in Herschel&#x27;s deep-sky catalog.</li><li>The cluster is also nicknamed the <strong>E.T. Cluster</strong> due to its resemblance to the famous extraterrestrial character from Steven Spielberg&#x27;s movie.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Best observed during the <strong>autumn and winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Cassiopeia is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Best Observing Tools</strong>: Binoculars or a small telescope can easily reveal the cluster&#x27;s bright stars and its distinctive &quot;owl-like&quot; shape.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: The Owl Cluster is located in a rich star field in Cassiopeia, making it a great target for stargazers exploring the region.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Shape and Name</strong>: The cluster&#x27;s &quot;owl-like&quot; appearance is due to the arrangement of its stars, with the two bright &quot;eyes&quot; and fainter stars forming the &quot;wings.&quot;</li><li><strong>Young Age</strong>: At only 20 million years old, the Owl Cluster is relatively young compared to other open clusters.</li><li><strong>Cultural Connection</strong>: Its nickname, the E.T. Cluster, adds a fun pop-culture connection for amateur astronomers.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Owl Cluster</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Cassiopeia</strong>: Locate the constellation Cassiopeia, which is shaped like a &quot;W&quot; or &quot;M&quot; in the northern sky.</li><li><strong>Use a Star Map</strong>: The Owl Cluster is located near the star <strong>Ruchbah (Delta Cassiopeiae)</strong>. A detailed star map or astronomy app can help pinpoint its exact location.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Observing from a dark-sky location will improve your view of the cluster&#x27;s fainter stars.</li></ol><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","carolines-rose","kembles-cascade-asterism"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/owl-cluster.jpg","title":"The Owl Cluster (NGC 457) - A Bright Open Star Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/owl-cluster","slug":"owl-cluster"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","owl-cluster"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/carolines-rose.jpg","title":"Caroline's Rose Cluster (NGC 7789) - A Stunning Open Cluster in Cassiopeia","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/carolines-rose","slug":"carolines-rose"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","related":["ngc-884-869-cluster","sun-01","north-star","betelguese","carolines-rose","owl-cluster"],"tags":["camelopardalis-constellation","asterism"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/kembles-cascade-asterism.jpg","title":"Kemble's Cascade Asterism - A Stunning Line of Stars in Camelopardalis","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/kembles-cascade-asterism","slug":"kembles-cascade-asterism"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","related":["carolines-rose","sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["perseus-constellation","cluster"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/ngc-884-869-cluster.jpg","title":"The Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884) - A Stunning Pair of Open Clusters in Perseus","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/ngc-884-869-cluster","slug":"ngc-884-869-cluster"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese","carolines-rose"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":["first-quarter-moon","waxing-gibbous-moon","jupiter"],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
