{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis)\" subtitle=\"A Red Supergiant in Orion\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Type</strong>: Red Supergiant (Spectral Type M1-2 Ia-ab)</li><li><strong>Constellation</strong>: Orion</li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>642 light-years</strong> (recent Gaia measurements estimate between <strong>500–700 light-years</strong>).</li><li><strong>Mass</strong>: Estimated to be <strong>10–20 times the mass of the Sun</strong>.</li><li><strong>Diameter</strong>: Betelgeuse is <strong>around 1,000 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter</strong> (if placed in the center of our Solar System, it would engulf the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and possibly Mars).</li><li><strong>Luminosity</strong>: Betelgeuse is <strong>about 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun</strong> in visible light.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: Ranges between <strong>+0.0 and +1.6</strong> due to its semi-regular variability.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Color</strong>: Betelgeuse appears as a distinct <strong>reddish star</strong> in the night sky, a hallmark of its cooler surface temperature (~3,500 K).</li><li><strong>Stage of Life</strong>: Betelgeuse is in the <strong>final stages of its life</strong> as a massive star. It will eventually end its life in a <strong>supernova explosion</strong>, possibly within the next 100,000 years.</li><li><strong>Variability</strong>: Classified as a <strong>semi-regular variable star</strong>, Betelgeuse&#x27;s brightness fluctuates due to complex pulsations in its outer layers.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Famous Dimming Event (2019–2020)</strong></h3><ul><li>In late 2019 and early 2020, Betelgeuse experienced an <strong>unprecedented dimming</strong>, dropping to about <strong>40% of its usual brightness</strong>.</li><li>This sparked speculation that Betelgeuse was on the verge of going supernova. However, astronomers determined that the dimming was caused by a <strong>combination of surface cooling and ejected material forming a dust cloud</strong>.</li><li>The event highlighted the dynamic and unpredictable behavior of red supergiants.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Cultural and Astronomical Significance</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Mythology</strong>: As part of the constellation Orion, Betelgeuse has been significant in many cultures and myths as one of the &quot;shoulders&quot; of the hunter.</li><li><strong>Navigation</strong>: Betelgeuse is one of the <strong>brightest stars in the night sky</strong>, making it an important navigational reference for stargazers and astronomers.</li><li><strong>Astronomical Studies</strong>: Betelgeuse has been the subject of extensive research, including <strong>direct imaging of its surface</strong>, which revealed its uneven brightness and massive convective cells.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Supernova Potential</strong>: When Betelgeuse explodes as a supernova, it will shine as brightly as a <strong>full moon</strong> in the sky and be visible during the day for weeks or months.</li><li><strong>Shape</strong>: Betelgeuse is not perfectly spherical. Observations show it has an irregular shape caused by <strong>convective activity</strong> and mass loss.</li><li><strong>Mass Loss</strong>: Betelgeuse is shedding its outer layers at an incredible rate, forming a vast shell of gas and dust around it.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Observe Betelgeuse</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Location</strong>: Betelgeuse is located in the <strong>constellation Orion</strong>, marking the <strong>left shoulder of the hunter</strong>.</li><li><strong>Best Time to View</strong>: Visible during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere (December through February).</li><li><strong>Brightness</strong>: Its variability makes it an interesting star to track over time!</li></ul><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese","carolines-rose"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["gemini-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/propus.jpg","title":"Propus (Eta Geminorum) - A Triple Star System in Gemini","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/propus","slug":"propus"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":["first-quarter-moon","waxing-gibbous-moon","jupiter"],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
