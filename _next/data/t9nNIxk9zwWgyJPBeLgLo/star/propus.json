{"pageProps":{"article":{"content":"<div title=\"Propus (Eta Geminorum)\" subtitle=\"A Triple Star System in Gemini\"></div><h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Propus (Eta Geminorum)</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Triple Star System</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Constellation <strong>Gemini</strong></li><li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong>: Approximately <strong>350 light-years</strong>.</li><li><strong>Apparent Magnitude</strong>: <strong>3.31</strong>, making it visible to the naked eye under good conditions.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Primary Star</strong>: The main component of Propus is a <strong>red giant star</strong> that has evolved off the main sequence. It is cooler and larger than the Sun.</li><li><strong>Companions</strong>: Propus is part of a <strong>triple star system</strong>, with two smaller companion stars orbiting the primary.</li><li>The primary star is classified as a <strong>semi-regular variable star</strong>, meaning its brightness varies slightly over time.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Astronomical Significance</strong></h3><ul><li>Propus is located near the <strong>Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443)</strong>, making it a useful reference point for locating the nebula in the night sky.</li><li>It is part of the <strong>Winter Hexagon</strong>, a prominent asterism in the winter sky that includes other bright stars like Betelgeuse, Sirius, and Procyon.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Observational Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Propus is best observed during the <strong>winter months</strong> in the Northern Hemisphere when Gemini is high in the sky.</li><li><strong>Color</strong>: The red giant primary star gives Propus a distinct reddish hue, which can be observed through binoculars or a small telescope.</li><li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: The star is located near the bright stars <strong>Castor</strong> and <strong>Pollux</strong>, as well as the Jellyfish Nebula.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Variable Star</strong>: The primary star&#x27;s variability is caused by pulsations in its outer layers as it nears the end of its life.</li><li><strong>Name Origin</strong>: The name &quot;Propus&quot; comes from the Greek word for &quot;forward foot,&quot; as it represents the foot of one of the twins in the constellation Gemini.</li><li><strong>Triple System</strong>: The gravitational interactions between the three stars in the system make it an interesting target for astronomers studying stellar dynamics.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate Propus</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Gemini</strong>: Locate the constellation Gemini in the night sky. Propus is near the &quot;foot&quot; of the twin represented by Pollux.</li><li><strong>Use Nearby Stars</strong>: Look for the bright stars Castor and Pollux, and then trace downward to find Propus.</li><li><strong>Enhance Visibility</strong>: Use binoculars or a small telescope to observe its reddish hue and nearby celestial objects.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>The star system was captured while viewing the Jellyfish nebula, which is also in the Gemini\nconstellation. The over exposure required for the Jellyfish nebula caused Propus to shine a bit\ntoo bright than I would have preferred. Nevertheless, it was a good capture that came as a bonus.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"star","date":"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","betelguese"],"tags":["gemini-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/propus.jpg","title":"Propus (Eta Geminorum) - A Triple Star System in Gemini","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/propus","slug":"propus"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","north-star","propus"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) - A Red Supergiant in Orion","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/betelguese","slug":"betelguese"},{"data":{"category":"star","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["sun-01","betelguese","carolines-rose"],"tags":["ursae-minoris-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/betelguese.jpg","title":"Polaris (The North Star) - A Guiding Light in the Night Sky","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/star/north-star","slug":"north-star"},{"data":{"category":"solar-system","date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","related":["first-quarter-moon","waxing-gibbous-moon","jupiter"],"tags":["solar-system","sun","star"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/sun-01.jpg","title":"Sunspot AR3917 - December 14, 2024","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/solar-system/sun-01","slug":"sun-01"}],"category":{"id":"star","title":"Star","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/star.jpg","description":"Brightest beams of the universe"}},"__N_SSG":true}
