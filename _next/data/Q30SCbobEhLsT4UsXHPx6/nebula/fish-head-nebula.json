Narrowband imaging techniques are often used to capture its details.</li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Shape and Name</strong>: The nebula is nicknamed the &quot;Fish Head Nebula&quot; because its shape resembles the head of a fish.</li><li><strong>Part of a Larger Complex</strong>: It is located at the narrow tip of the Heart Nebula and is part of a massive star-forming region that includes the Heart and Soul Nebulae.</li><li><strong>Hubble Palette Imaging</strong>: Many images of the Fish Head Nebula are processed using the <strong>Hubble Color Palette</strong>, which maps specific wavelengths of light (H-alpha, OIII, and SII) to RGB colors.</li></ol><hr/><h3><strong>How to Locate the Fish Head Nebula</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Find Cassiopeia</strong>: Look for the &quot;W&quot;-shaped constellation Cassiopeia in the northern sky.</li><li><strong>Locate the Heart Nebula</strong>: The Fish Head Nebula is located at the tip of the Heart Nebula (IC 1805), near the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way.</li><li><strong>Use a Telescope</strong>: A telescope with a wide field of view and narrowband filters will help reveal the nebula&#x27;s structure and colors.</li></ol><hr/><p><img src=\"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/fish-head-nebula-1.jpg\" alt=\"A 50 minute exposure\"/></p><h3><strong>Personal Note</strong></h3><p>Although a slight enhancement of the colours was required to make the nebula more visible in the\npicture, the expectation was to have it clear on its own. Unfortunately, the capture failed after\n22 minutes of exposure, which still was good enough to get an outline of the nebula.</p><p>For the second image, the nebula was exposed for 50 minutes. This brought out the distinct outline\nand a better resolution. Personal recommendation would be to go to a more isolated place with less\nlight pollution to observe this particular nebula.</p><hr/>","data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","flame-nebula"],"tags":["cassiopeia-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/fish-head-nebula.jpg","title":"The Fish Head Nebula (IC 1795)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/fish-head-nebula","slug":"fish-head-nebula"},"related":[{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","related":["horsehead-nebula","north-america-nebula","fish-head-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/flame-nebula.jpg","title":"The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/flame-nebula","slug":"flame-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula"],"tags":["orion-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/horsehead-nebula.JPG","title":"The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33)","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/horsehead-nebula","slug":"horsehead-nebula"},{"data":{"category":"nebula","date":"2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","related":["flame-nebula","horsehead-nebula","owl-nebula"],"tags":["cygnus-constellation"],"thumbnail":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/north-american-nebula.jpg","title":"The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) - A Cosmic Cloud in the Shape of a Continent","writtenBy":"ankon"},"permalink":"/nebula/north-america-nebula","slug":"north-america-nebula"}],"category":{"id":"nebula","title":"Nebula","imagePath":"/deep-space-observatory-5/images/nebula.JPG","description":"The darkest wonders of the cosmos"}},"__N_SSG":true}
